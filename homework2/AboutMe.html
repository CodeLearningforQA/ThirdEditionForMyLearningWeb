<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>First of all, my name is Do Ngoc Quynh Anh and I'm 19. Now, I am a freshman majoring in Software Engineering
    at FPT University - HCMC Campus. </p>
<p>Lately, I'm diving into the content of Web Design. It seems to be boring at first, however, it's getting
    cooler and more fascinating.
    To be honest, HTML, I mean I've just learn this only in Web Design, is quite different compared to C, or
    Java, the way of organizing the code is different, when in HTML, there are a lot of text.</p>
<p>And below is a picture of me.</p>

<br><br> I've just started in University Life for nearly 8 months. And I don't really have any specialized
skill, however, I'm already on the way enhancing them, including both soft skills or hard skills.
<br><br>If you want to follow my path: This is my professional profile I'm building. <br>
